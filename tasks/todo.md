# Update README

## Plan
Replace the default Scaffold-ETH 2 README with a BLUFF-specific README that covers:
- Project description and branding
- Tech stack overview
- Setup/quickstart instructions
- Project structure

## TODO
- [x] Rewrite README.md with BLUFF content

## Review
Replaced the default Scaffold-ETH 2 boilerplate README with a BLUFF-specific README. Covers project description, how-it-works flow, tech stack table, quickstart setup, project structure, and contract verification. Kept it concise and relevant.
